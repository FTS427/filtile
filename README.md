# Filtile

This is a layout manager for the [River](https://codeberg.org/river/river) window manager. It's a drop-in replacement for `rivertile`, but with a few things added and configuration per tag/output.

## Getting Started

After you install, you can simply replace all instances of `rivertile` with `filtile` in your config to keep everything the same (but switch to per-tag configuration). If you want more than that, you can read the manual doc under the `doc/` folder.

## Installation

You can run the `install.sh` to install filtile (manual doc installation neeeds change `INSTALL_DOC` to `yes` in the script and run the script with root permission).

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
